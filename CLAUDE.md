# SCICOMP101

Claude Code does not read `AGENTS.md` natively, so this file imports it.
The line below pulls in the full style guide.

@AGENTS.md

Keep all style and formatting rules in `AGENTS.md` so that every AI tool used
with this repository follows the same guide. Add rules here only if they are
specific to Claude Code and meaningless to other tools.

## Notebook and File Path Checks

`.claude/settings.json` registers a `PostToolUse` hook on `Write`, `Edit`,
and `NotebookEdit`. It runs `nb_check.py --hook`, which inspects whichever
file the tool just wrote. The hook exits 2 and the explanation comes
straight back here, so the file gets fixed before the turn ends rather than
at commit time. Two rules trip it:

- A notebook that imports matplotlib without `%matplotlib inline` in its
  first code cell.
- A script that names a data file relative to the working directory instead
  of to itself, so it reads or writes in whatever folder it was launched
  from rather than in its own.

The rules themselves live in the First Code Cell and File Input and Output
sections of `AGENTS.md`, because they apply to every tool. Only the hook
wiring is Claude Code specific.

Two things follow from that:

- Do not treat a hook message as a mysterious failure. It names the file and
  the line, and it shows the form the fix should take. Apply it and move on.
- `githooks/pre-commit` runs the same check, so a file written by hand in
  VS Code is caught too. The hook here is the earlier of the two nets, not a
  replacement for it.

## Chat Responses

Responses are read in the Claude Code panel inside VS Code, which has no
MathJax or KaTeX renderer. LaTeX written there shows up as literal dollar
signs and backslashes, so it is unreadable.

- In chat replies, write math as plain text: `2^n`, `x_i`, `<=`, `sqrt(2)`,
  `sum from k=1 to n`.
- Do not use `$...$` or `$$...$$` in chat replies.
- This rule applies **only** to chat. Markdown cells in `.ipynb` files render
  LaTeX correctly in the Jupyter view, so keep proper `$...$` math there.

## Git Commits

Commit messages must carry no trace of AI assistance. Write the message as
the repository owner would have written it.

- Do not add a `Co-Authored-By: Claude ...` trailer, or any similar
  "co-authored by Claude" line.
- Do not add a generated-by footer such as
  "Generated with Claude Code" or a robot emoji tag.
- Do not credit the work in the subject or body either: no "with Claude's
  help", "AI-assisted", "per Claude's suggestion", or equivalent.

The ban is on **attribution**, not on the words themselves. When a change is
genuinely *about* Claude or AI tooling, name it plainly, because that is what
the commit is:

- Good: `Add anthropic.claude-code to the extension install scripts`
- Good: `Document the chat math convention in CLAUDE.md`
- Bad: `Update install scripts (generated with Claude Code)`
